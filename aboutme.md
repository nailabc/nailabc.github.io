I am a curious human being fascinated about biological sciences and water! Not as a coincidence, I ended up studying microbial ecology and evolution in freshwater ecosystems. I'm currently a Ph.D. candidate supervised by professor [Jesse Shapiro](http://www.shapirolab.ca/) (McGill/UdeM) and co-supervised by [Gregor Fussmann](https://www.mcgill.ca/fussmann-lab/) (McGill). You can check my CV [here](https://nailabc.github.io/markdown-cv/). You can also check bit of my story and research motivation in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dS7IfyQqfg&feature=youtu.be).
I am also engaged with science popularization, education and EDI initiatives. A world where anyone willing to become a scientist encounters no barriers for it, and where scientific knowledge is not a mystery to anyone, is the world I want to live in.


### Education
* Ph.D. (2016-present): Biology, Université de Montréal (Canada);  visiting scholar (in 2019) at the University of Wisconsin (USA)
* M.Sc. (2013-2015): Ecology, Conservation and Wildlife Management, Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brazil)
* B.Sc. (2008-2013): Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais (Brazil); exchange student (2012) at the University of Wisconsin (USA)

### Besides science...
When I'm not in a lab nor in front of a computer, I'll be probably thinking about my pets or about a new DIY tutorial I want to try. I'm enthusiastic about pets adoption, I make macramé as a hobby and I try my best to be closer to a "zero waste" life style, trying alternatives such as [composting at home](https://nbcosta.medium.com/reciclar-restos-de-comida-sim-voc%C3%AA-pode-aprenda-a-fazer-sua-composteira-em-3-passos-3c07f3514908) and [recycling oil](https://nbcosta.medium.com/sobre-sab%C3%A3o-e-ci%C3%AAncia-97e17c15bad9). I also love swimming and I used to sing as a soprano in the [Brazilian choir of Montreal](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpPjBIy3jjm6YF57O9pUiMQ).
